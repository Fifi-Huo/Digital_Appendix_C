The accompanying files contain Python scripts (and associated data) developed and documented in the Master thesis entitled “Improving detection of clouds above Antarctica using visible/thermal infrared satellite imagery with machine learning”. These scripts implement machine learning models for cloud detecting above Antarctica.

The directory structure for Appendix C is as follows:

• Digital_Appendix_C

	– Data_procress (Python code and scripts for data pre-processing) 
	
	– Dataset (Training and testing set for this thesis)
	
	– ml (Python code and scripts for machine learning models)

Dataset merges two satellite products from the A-train constellation (https://atrain.nasa.gov/): the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from Aqua satellite (https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/) and the 2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR product derived from the combination of CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and CALIPSO Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) (http://www.cloudsat.cira.colostate.edu/data- products/level-2b/2b-cldclass-lidar).
